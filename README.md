# Splatoon-2-Meta-Modeling

-Player data gathered from stat.ink, a site where players can voluntarily upload their match data.

-Data currently stored as a large batch of csv's, possibly create a database.

-Predict win rate by modeling binary win/loss and using predict percent.

-Try using random forests, gradient boosting, and neural networks.

-Possibly attempt to connect buffs/nerfs from patches into the model (not sure how this would work yet).

-If time allows, create a simple interface like a flask website to output predictions based on user submitted data (may not be practical depending on how many predictors the model ends up using).
